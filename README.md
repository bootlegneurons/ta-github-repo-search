# Technical Assessment May 2020 - GitHub repository search

Coming soon.

# Getting started
In a terminal, from the root directory:
```
npm i
```
__IMPORTANT:__ You must create a github API token and add this to a custom `.env` file. You can copy `.env.example` and remove the extension, then add your token to the empty `REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN` key.

See [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) for instructions on setting up a token. The token only needs access to read public repositories.
